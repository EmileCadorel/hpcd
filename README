Collection of libraries for HPC in the D language (D2)

o MPI - using a thin C wrapper to interface with variety of MPI implementations
        Most commonly used functions working, but NOT:
          - Any involving user callbacks e.g. getting and setting error handlers
          - MPI_Aint types and associated functions e.g. MPI_Address, MPI_Put, MPI_Get
          - MPI IO file operations

o PETSc - Some basic examples working (petscsys)


Intended to work with a range of MPI implementations e.g. Open MPI, MPICH, LAM etc.

NOTE: Should be linked against C versions of these libraries, not
      C++. PETSc should be compiled with Clanguage = C.
      This is due to name mangling which pulls MPI implementation specific
      names (e.g. omp_communicator_t) into the function names.

Tested with configurations:
  - DMD32 D Compiler v2.059, Open MPI and gcc version 4.4.5 (Debian 4.4.5-8)
